Local JS libraries (no CDN) have been wired.

REPLACE THESE PLACEHOLDERS WITH REAL FILES:
  /static/html5-qrcode.min.js   ← get from: https://unpkg.com/html5-qrcode@2.3.9/html5-qrcode.min.js
  /static/tesseract.min.js      ← get from: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tesseract.js@5/dist/tesseract.min.js

After replacing, redeploy and hard refresh on iPhone (Safari).
If you run into CSP issues, the local files avoid external hosts entirely.
